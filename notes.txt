Currently only supporting curseforge downloads.

Configuration file holds an array of directories that contain multimc config
files.

If not set, defaults to $HOME/.local/share/multimc.

Pull the instance directory paths from the config file(s).

In each instance dir parse modlist.cfg. See sample cfg for details on format.

For each mod:

Get cfwidget page (it should be cached once every 24 hours) and parse
information from it based on what was on the modlist config line.

Get the appropriate files page (it should be cached once every 24 hours) and
grab the md5sum, and whatever else is needed.

If the jar does not exist, or does not match the md5sum, download the jar file
and store it. Defaults to "$MultiMC_DIR/mods".

Create a link for the correct version of the mod in the instance mods dir.

TODO:

Do the same for resource packs, texture packs and mod packs.
